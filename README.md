The variable of interest is bill length (mm) and the bill depth (mm). Since we want to explore the relationship between the 2 variables, the formula should be a linear regression model: bill length= beta_0 + beta_1*bill depth + error. Taking bill length as the response variable. We should verify that the error has a constant variance.
